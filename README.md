### Description
##### Problem
People who are visually impaired face no shortage of problems in India. Blind people use canes, but the traditional cane can't detect objects higher than the waist.
##### Solution
An IoT based solution to detect the proximity as well as the type of hurdle. The person while holding his mobile device records a video. It detects objects in real time and uses an IR sensor to detect the distance of the object. The application, according to this input, warns the user of the obstacle.
### Tech Stack
* nodejs
* Arduino
* C++
##### APIs Used
* IBM Watson for object detection
* (say) for text-to-speech
#### Progress
* Right now we were able to implement the hardware solution. Our system is detecting that there is a obstacle in its path. Also our image detection is working properly. now we just need to take input for object detection and implement these two features together.
